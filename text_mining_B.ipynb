labour market and in turn can develop an anti-social behaviour.', 'Excluding young people from the labour market means lacking the divergent thinking, creativity and innovation that they naturally offer.', '== Effects of minimum wages ==\\nEconomic research indicates that minimum wages increases youth unemployment in competitive labour markets for unskilled youth labour, and that the resulting

==\\n\\n\\n=== The role of labour market policy and institutions ===\\n\\nThe role of labour market policy and institutions varies a lot from countries to countries.', 'One Active Labour Market Policy (ALMP) that many governments have put emphasis on in an attempt to tackle unemployment is to directly help unemployed individuals transition to self-employment.', '=== Teaching 21st-century skills ===\\nThe education system plays a central role in the debate about the youth labour market crisis.', 'All educational institutions should work towards adopting or creating a suitable skills framework

universities can modify to fit their communities or to accommodate changes in the market.\"', 'This solution ties back with labour market and regulations as many reforms are yet to be implemented to ensure that the market is flexible enough to incentivize young people to create enterprises.', 'A systematic review assessed the evidence on the effectiveness of different types of interventions to

cuts, reduced government spending, free markets, deregulation, privatization, minimal government debt, and a balanced budget.', 'Fiscal conservatives often argue that competition in the free market is more effective than the regulation of industry and is the most efficient way to promote economic growth.', 'Classical liberals supported free markets on moral, ideological grounds: principles of individual liberty morally dictate support for free markets.', 'Supporters of the moral grounds for free markets include Ayn Rand and Ludwig von Mises.', 'The liberal tradition is suspicious of government authority and prefers individual choice, and hence tends to see free market capitalism as the preferable means of achieving economic ends.', 'The classical liberal maintains that free markets work best, while the libertarian contends that free markets are the only ethical markets.', '=== Reagan Era ===\\n\\nThe archetypal free market conservative administrations of the late 20th century, the Margaret Thatcher government in Britain and the Reagan administration in the U.S., both held unfettered operation of the market to be the cornerstone of contemporary modern conservatism.', 'Speer adds that these developments have caused \"an erosion of the conservative consensus involving free markets, social conservatism, and a hawkish foreign policy (sometimes

individual agents and markets, their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions.', 'Some subsequent comments criticised the definition as overly broad in failing to limit its subject matter to analysis of markets.', 'Gary Becker, a contributor to the expansion of economics into new areas, described the approach he favoured as \"combin[ing the] assumptions of maximizing behaviour, stable preferences, and market equilibrium, used relentlessly and unflinchingly.\"', 'His \"theorem\" that \"the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market\" has been described as the \"core of a theory of the functions of firm and industry\" and a \"fundamental principle of economic organization.\"', 'Coming at the end of the classical tradition, John Stuart Mill (1848) parted company with the earlier classical economists on the inevitability of the distribution of income produced by the market system.', \"Mill pointed to a distinct difference between the market's two roles: allocation of resources and distribution of income.\", 'The market might be efficient in allocating resources but not in distributing income, he wrote, making it necessary for society to intervene.', 'Classical economics focused on the tendency of any market economy to settle in a final stationary state made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant population size.', 'Neoclassical economics systematically integrated supply and demand as joint determinants of both price and quantity in market equilibrium, influencing the allocation of output and income distribution.', 'Modern mainstream economics builds on neoclassical economics but with many refinements that either supplement or generalise earlier analysis, such as econometrics, game theory, analysis of market failure and imperfect competition, and the neoclassical model of economic growth for analysing long-run variables affecting national income.', 'They adopted the principle of rational expectations and other monetarist or new classical ideas such as building upon models employing micro foundations and optimizing behaviour, but simultaneously emphasised the importance of various market failures for the functioning of the economy, as had Keynes.', 'It integrated the rational expectations and optimizing framework of the new classical theory with a new Keynesian role for nominal rigidities and other market imperfections like imperfect information in goods, labour and credit markets.', '== Microeconomics ==\\n\\nMicroeconomics examines how entities, forming a market structure, interact within a market to create a market system.', 'Various market structures exist.', 'In perfectly competitive markets, no participants are large enough to have the market power to set the price of a homogeneous product.', 'In the real world, markets often experience imperfect competition.', 'In partial equilibrium method of analysis, it is assumed that activity in the market being analysed does not affect other markets.', 'This method aggregates (the sum of all activity) in only one market.', 'General-equilibrium theory studies various markets and their behaviour.', 'It aggregates (the sum of all activity) across all markets.', 'This method studies both changes in markets and their interactions leading towards equilibrium.', 'Still, in a market economy, movement along the curve may indicate that the choice of the increased output is anticipated to be worth the cost to the agents.', 'Theory and observation set out the conditions such that market prices of outputs and productive inputs select an allocation of factor inputs by comparative advantage, so that (relatively) low-cost inputs go to producing low-cost outputs.', '=== Supply and demand ===\\n\\nPrices and quantities have been described as the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a market economy.', 'In microeconomics, it applies to price and output determination for a market with perfect competition, which includes the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price-setting power.', 'For a given market of a commodity, demand is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price of the good.', 'The law of demand states that, in general, price and quantity demanded in a given market are inversely related.', 'Market equilibrium occurs where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, the intersection of the supply and demand curves in the figure above.', '=== Firms ===\\n\\nPeople frequently do not trade directly on markets.', 'According to Ronald Coase, people begin to organise their production in firms when the costs of doing business becomes lower than doing it on the market.', 'Firms combine labour and capital, and can achieve far greater economies of scale (when the average cost per unit declines as more units are produced) than individual market trading.', 'In perfectly competitive markets studied in the theory of supply and demand, there are many producers, none of which significantly influence price.', 'It considers the structure of such markets and their interactions.', 'Common market structures studied besides perfect competition include monopolistic competition, various forms of oligopoly, and monopoly.', \"A unifying theme is the attempt to optimise business decisions, including unit-cost minimisation and profit maximisation, given the firm's objectives and constraints imposed by technology and market conditions.\", 'Without it, household behaviour would be unaffected by uncertain employment and income prospects, financial and capital markets would reduce to exchange of a single instrument in each market period, and there would be no communications industry.', 'In this, it generalises maximisation approaches developed to analyse market actors such as in the supply and demand model and allows for incomplete information of actors.', 'Risk aversion may stimulate activity that in well-functioning markets smooths out risk and communicates information about risk, as in markets for insurance, commodity futures contracts, and financial instruments.', 'It also analyses the pricing of financial instruments, the financial structure of companies, the efficiency and fragility of financial markets, financial crises, and related government policy or regulation.', 'Some market organisations may give rise to inefficiencies associated with uncertainty.', 'Based on George Akerlof\\'s \"Market for Lemons\" article, the paradigm example is of a dodgy second-hand car market.', 'Both problems may raise insurance costs and reduce efficiency by driving otherwise willing transactors from the market (\"incomplete markets\").', 'Applied subjects include market and legal remedies to spread or reduce risk, such as warranties, government-mandated partial insurance, restructuring or bankruptcy law, inspection, and regulation for quality and information disclosure.', '=== Market failure ===\\n\\nThe term \"market failure\" encompasses several problems which may undermine standard economic assumptions.', 'Although economists categorise market failures differently, the following categories emerge in the main texts.', 'Information asymmetries and incomplete markets may result in economic inefficiency but also a possibility of improving efficiency through market, legal, and regulatory remedies, as discussed above.', 'Public goods are goods which are under-supplied in a typical market.', 'Externalities occur where there are significant social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices.', 'Examples of such price stickiness in particular markets include wage rates in labour markets and posted prices in markets deviating from perfect competition.', 'Some specialised fields of economics deal in market failure more than others.', 'Policy options include regulations that reflect cost–benefit analysis or market solutions that change incentives, such as emission fees or redefinition of property rights.', 'Since at least the 1960s, macroeconomics has been characterised by further integration as to micro-based modelling of sectors, including rationality of players, efficient use of market information, and imperfect competition.', 'New classical macroeconomics, as distinct from the Keynesian view of the business cycle, posits market clearing with imperfect information.', 'In contrast, the new Keynesian approach retains the rational expectations assumption, however it assumes a variety of market failures.', \"The primary monetary tool is normally the adjustment of interest rates, either directly via administratively changing the central bank's own interest rates or indirectly via open market operations.\", '=== Labour economics ===\\n\\nLabour economics seeks to understand the functioning and dynamics of the markets for wage labour.', 'Labour markets function through the interaction of workers and employers.', 'He and Kevin Murphy authored a book in 2001 that analysed market behaviour in a social environment.', 'By acting as consultants, they provide targeted solutions that help businesses optimize their workforce and achieve organizational objectives in complex and evolving market conditions.', 'Effective international business strategies require astute market analysis, risk assessment, and adaptation to local customs and preferences.', 'The role of technology cannot be overstated, as advancements in communication and transportation have drastically reduced barriers to entry and expanded market reach.', 'To conduct business overseas, multinational companies need to bridge separate national markets into one global marketplace.', 'A multinational enterprise (MNE) is a company that has a worldwide approach to markets, production and/or operations in several countries.', 'Multinational enterprises range from any kind of business activity or market, from consumer goods to machinery manufacture; a company can become an international business.', 'Therefore, to conduct business overseas, companies should be aware of all the factors that might affect any business activities, including, but not limited to: difference in legal systems, political systems, economic policy, language, accounting standards, labor standards, living standards, environmental standards,

of FDI; where an imperfect market structure is the key element.', 'The second determinant is the removal of control where Hymer wrote: \"When firms are interconnected, they compete in selling in the same market or one of the firms may sell to the other,\" and because of this \"it may be profitable to substitute centralized decision-making for decentralized decision-making\".', 'Value creation can

Lamoreaux for explaining the steep price falls is to view the involved firms acting as monopolies in their respective markets.', \"To return to the quasi-monopoly model, in order for a firm to earn profit, firms would steal part of another firm's market share by dropping their price slightly and producing to the point where higher quantity and lower price exceeded their average total cost.\", 'The most viable solution to this problem was for firms to merge, through horizontal integration, with other top firms in the market in order to control a large market share and thus successfully set a higher price.', 'For example, retail companies are buying tech or e-commerce firms to acquire new markets and revenue streams.', 'Paul Graham recognized this in his 2005 essay \"Hiring is

economic system is called a social market economy.', '=== 21st century ===\\n\\nWith the fall of the Iron Curtain and the transition of the countries of the Eastern Bloc towards democratic government and market economies, the idea of the post-industrial society is brought into importance as its role is to mark together the significance that the service sector receives instead of industrialization.', '== Elements ==\\n\\n\\n=== Types ===\\nA market economy is one where goods and services are produced and exchanged according to demand and supply between participants (economic agents) by barter or a medium of exchange with a credit or debit value accepted within the network, such as a unit of currency.', '=== Indicators ===\\n\\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) of a country is a measure of the size of its economy, or more specifically, monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced.', 'Due to the growing importance of the financial sector in modern times, the term real economy is used by analysts as well as politicians to denote the part of the economy that is concerned with the actual production of goods and services, as ostensibly contrasted with the paper economy, or the financial side of the economy, which is concerned with buying and selling on the financial markets.', 'Specific acquisition targets can be identified through myriad avenues, including market research, trade expos, sent up from internal business units, or supply chain analysis.', 'The core value of a business, which accrues to both categories of stakeholders, is called the Enterprise Value (EV), whereas the value which accrues just to shareholders is the Equity Value (also called market capitalization for publicly listed companies).', \"For public companies, the market based enterprise value and equity value can be calculated by referring to the company's share price and components on its balance sheet.\", 'The valuation methods described above represent ways to determine value of a company independently from how the market currently, or historically, has determined value based on the price of its outstanding securities.', 'Economy of scope: This refers to the efficiencies primarily associated with demand-side changes, such as increasing or decreasing the scope of marketing and distribution, of different types of products.', 'Increased revenue or market share: This assumes that the buyer will be absorbing a major competitor and thus increase its market power (by capturing increased market share) to set prices.', 'Absorption of similar businesses under single management: similar portfolio invested by two different mutual funds namely united money market fund and united growth and income fund, caused the management to absorb united money market fund into united growth and income fund.', 'Megadeals—deals of at least one $1 billion in size—tend to fall into four discrete categories: consolidation, capabilities extension, technology-driven market transformation, and going private.', '== Different types ==\\n\\n\\n=== By functional roles in market ===\\nThe M&A process itself is a multifaceted which depends upon the type of merging companies.', 'This means that synergy can be obtained through many forms such as; increased market share, cost savings and exploring new market opportunities.', 'This type of M&A process aims at creating synergies in the long run by increased market share, broad customer base, and corporate strength of business.', 'During this time, small firms with little market share consolidated with similar firms to form large, powerful institutions that dominated their markets, such as the Standard Oil Company, which at its height controlled nearly 90% of the global oil refinery industry.', 'It is estimated that more than 1,800 of these firms disappeared into consolidations, many of which acquired substantial shares of the markets in which they operated.', 'There were also other companies that held the greatest market share in 1905 but at the same time did not have the competitive advantages of the companies like DuPont and General Electric.', 'These companies such as International Paper and American Chicle saw their market share decrease significantly by 1929 as smaller competitors joined forces with each other and provided much more competition.', 'Another economic model proposed by Naomi R. Lamoreaux for explaining the steep price falls is to view the involved firms acting as monopolies in their respective markets.', \"To return to the quasi-monopoly model, in order for a firm to earn profit, firms would steal part of another firm's market share by dropping their price slightly and producing to the point where higher quantity and lower price exceeded their average total cost.\", 'The most viable solution to this problem was for firms to merge, through horizontal integration, with other top firms in the market in order to control a large market share and thus successfully set a higher price.', 'For example, retail companies are buying tech or e-commerce firms to acquire new markets and revenue streams.', 'Paul Graham recognized this in his 2005 essay \"Hiring is Obsolete\", in which he theorizes that the free market is better at identifying talent, and that traditional hiring practices do not follow the principles of free market because they depend a lot upon credentials and university degrees.', 'Many companies are being bought for their patents, licenses, market share, name brand, research staff, methods, customer base, or culture.', 'Approximately 23 percent of the 416 M&A deals announced in the U.S. M&A market in 2014 involved non-U.S. acquirers.', 'For 2016, market uncertainties, including Brexit and the potential reform from a U.S. presidential election, contributed to cross-border M&A activity lagging roughly 20% behind 2015 activity.', 'It is advisable that M&A tools designed for mature economies are not directly used in emerging markets without some adjustment.', 'M&A teams need time to adapt and understand the key operating differences between their home environment and their new market.', 'For the dimension strategic management, the six strategic variables: market similarity, market complementarities, production operation similarity, production operation complementarities, market power, and purchasing power were identified as having an important effect on M&A performance.', 'An empirical research study conducted between 1988 and 2002 found that \"Successful acquisitions, as defined by return on investment and time to market, are more likely to involve complex products but minimal uncertainty about whether the product is functional and whether there is an appetite in the market.\"', 'A recommendation to resolve these failed mergers is to wait for the product to become established in the market and research has been completed.', 'Market dominant companies can also be their own demise when presented with an M&A opportunity.', 'Complacency and lack of due diligence may cause the market dominant company to miss the value of an innovative product or service.', '\"Stock market bubble effects on mergers and acquisitions\".', 'Global Journal of Emerging Market Economies.', 'M&A Market: The New Normal.', 'The biggest circle representing the employing organization is located in a market, making it easy to get affected by various external factors.', \"=== Department management ===\\nAccounting management – Field of business administration, part of the internal accounting system of a companyPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\\nCommunications management – System of communication in an organization\\nEngineering management – Overview of management in engineering\\nEnterprise content management – Implementation of information technology management\\nFinancial management\\nCapital management – The management of capital assets and investments\\nManagerial finance – part of the economic and business process is divided into investment, financing and risk managementPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\\nOutline of finance – Overview of finance and finance-related topics\\nHuman resource management – Approach to the effective management of people in a company\\nInformation technology management\\nEnterprise legal management – Field of business administration on legal issues\\nMarketing management – Practical application of marketing in organizations\\nProcurement – Acquisition of goods and services\\nProduct management – Organizational role in companies\\nRecords management – Management of the information and records of an organization\\nSupply chain management – Management of the flow of goods and services\\n\\n\\n=== Field- or organization-specific management ===\\nAssociation management\\nCommunity management – the management of a common resource or issue by a communityPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\\nEducational management – Administration of education systems\\nFacility management – Interdisciplinary field\\nInvestment management – Professional asset management of securities for the benefit of investors\\nLand management – Processes of managing land\\nPublic administration – Academic discipline;
